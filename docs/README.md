The literature reports the discovery of stars that show spectral energy distribution very close to a blackbody radiation. 
We combine the photometry from Gaia DR2, SDSS, PanSTARRs... to search for any star consistent with a blackbody radiation spectrum at XXX mmag. 

Preliminary inspection shows that these stars have on average an effective temperature compatible with being White Dwarfs (WDs) of type DB(?)

In this project, we analyze these objects (and more) using a blackbody model of their SEDs to derive their temperatures and distances.
We further use the Gaia's proper motions and parallaxes to derive their orbital properties.

We discuss the value of this sample of objects for the precise calibration of photometry and in particular the BP/RP spectra of Gaia to be released with Gaia data release 3, in 2022. Regardless of the the physical nature of these objects represent standard candles for the calibration of instruments.
